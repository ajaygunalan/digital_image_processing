# DIPUM Toolbox 3

DIPUM Toolbox 3 contains MATLAB functions were created for the book *Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB*, 3rd edition, by R.C. Gonzalez, R.E. Woods, and S.L. Eddins, Gatesmark, 2020.  The functions supplement and extend the image processing functionality of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html), 
both offered by [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com).

## Requirements

This release of the DIPUM Toolbox works with R2016b or later of MATLAB and Image Processing Toolbox.  The DIPUM Toolbox is not supported for use with earlier versions of MATLAB or Image Processing Toolbox. Most DIPUM functions require Image Processing Toolbox.

The DIPUM Toolbox works with all MATLAB platforms.  It includes one MEX-file (UNRAVEL, which is used for Huffman decoding).  Compiled binaries for this MEX-file are provided for all MATLAB platforms.

## Installation

To install the DIPUM Toolbox, go to the [releases area](https://github.com/dipum/dipum-toolbox/releases) and download the latest dipum-toolbox.mltbx file. In MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file and double-click on it in the MATLAB Current Folder Browser. An installer will open to guide you through the installation process.

Alternatively, download the latest code from the [DIPUM Toolbox
repository](https://github.com/dipum/dipum-toolbox) and add all the
code folders to the MATLAB Search Path. In the MATLAB HOME tab, click
on Set Path. Then, click on "Add with Subfolders..." and select the
top-level folder containing the DIPUM Toolbox files.
